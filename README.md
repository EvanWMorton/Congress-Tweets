# Congress-Tweets
Analysis of tweets by members of the US Congress.  Below are some preliminary results.

From Apr 25 to June 6, there were about 48k tweets.  Here is a table how many tweets from each party contained certain terms.  It's done simply by substring, so the count for "gun" includes anything with "guns" (that's a feature) or "begun" (that's a bug).  Case-insensitive.
